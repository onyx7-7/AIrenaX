AIrenaX is a smart stadium management system designed to enhance the fan experience. The app leverages AI technologies to improve crowd management, provide personalized navigation, and offer virtual queueing for stadium services.

## MVP Features

### 1. **AI-powered Crowd Detection**
   - The app uses AI models like YOLO to monitor and assess crowd density in the stadium.
   - Helps identify areas of high congestion and optimize crowd movement, improving overall stadium safety and comfort.

### 2. **Virtual Queueing**
   - Fans can join virtual queues for services like food, beverages, or merchandise from their seats.
   - The app sends notifications to users when itâ€™s their turn, minimizing wait times and preventing long lines.

### 3. **Personalized Seat Navigation**
   - The app uses AR/VR technology to guide fans to their seats and around the stadium.
   - Makes use of computer vision models like Mask R-CNN for seat detection and SLAM for navigation to provide real-time directions.
